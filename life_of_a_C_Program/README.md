Writing a simple C program which contains a function to observe the kind of assembly code generated

To compile system-independent code, we need the flag -ffreestanding, so compile function.c in this fashion; this produces an object file, function.o

```sh
$  gcc -ffreestanding -c function.c -o function.o
```


To examine the machine code generated by the compiler:

```sh
$ objdump -d function.o
```
We will use the linker inorder to produce the binary file, function.bin. An important part of this step is to learn how high level languages call function labels. Which is the offset where our function will be placed in memory?

```sh
$ ld -o function.bin -Ttext 0x0 --oformat binary function.o
```

Finally, we use the diassembler to see what machine code has been generated :

```sh
$ ndisasm -b 32 function.bin
```
